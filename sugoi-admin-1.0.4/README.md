This is an introduction to the template. You will find more information
in relevant files.

## Grunt.js
This template was built using [Grunt.js](http://gruntjs.com/) for your
ease of development. Visit their site if you are not yet familiar with
Grunt.

`Gruntfile.coffee` offers two tasks: development and build.
You can run them by going to the project directory and running `grunt
name_of_the_task` from a command line. Here's a brief description of
what each task will do for you:

# `grunt dev`
This task will do the following:
 
 - compile your SASS files from `scss` directory
 - watch for style changes and live inject them
 - run a ghost-server (all your connected devices will follow
mouse clicks and scroll events
 - compile your `js/admin.coffee`
 - provide tips with jsHint for your code
 - watch for other file changes and react with page refresh


#`grunt build`
Once you are done with development, it's time to build  your project. I
strongly recommend going thru Gruntfile.coffee once again and applying
proper changes. Also, I recommend using `grunt-contrib-concat` plugin to
concatinate JavaScript files which are shared between multiple pages as
well as commenting out unused `.scss` files from `scss` folder in
`admin.scss`. This task will do the following:
 
 - Build minified stylesheets
 - Build minified JavaScripts
 - minify images for web
 - Copy everything to `build` folder

# Where do I start?
I recommend going thru `ui.html` file as well as reading thru comments
and links from `scss/admin.scss` file. It will give you an overview of
principles followed in this project and you'll see how easy it is to
customize it to your needs!
